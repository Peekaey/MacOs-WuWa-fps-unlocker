# FPS cap unlocker for Wuthering Waves on MacOS
Wuthering Waves officially only supports 120 FPS on M3 Pro/Max/Ultra, M4/M4 Pro/Max and only supports up to 60 FPS for M1/M2 series.
This application allows you to increase the game's FPS cap to 120 from 60 for M1/M2 series Macs.

It works by altering the LocalStorage game configuration file to set the appropriate key value pairs to a value that will force 120 FPS as the frame cap
